# PE Program Report - Image Lab 2018 Summer 

## Goals

Our project is about recognizing the bone fracture using pytorch. And Before that, to get used to pytorch, we first design **autoencoder** of our own.

We must produce meaningful results within 2 weeks. 

My job is to make an encoder part of autoencoder.

### 1. To Create Tensor
To create a random matrix which called **tensor**, we can use rand function, which needs **two parameters**. 

And we assign this return value(matrix) to the variable.

<pre><code>import torch

randomMat = torch.rand(3,4)
</code></pre>

### 2. Various Functions
Generating tensor can be subdivided into several functions with various roles.

* torch.randn(a,b)
  * This method creates random matrix with normal distribution with size (a,b).
  
* torch.randperm(n)
  * This method creates random matrix with permutation of 0~n.

* torch.zeros(a,b)
  * This method creates matrix that is filled with 0s and size (a,b).
  
* torch.ones(a,b)
  * Same as zeros but filled with 1s.
  
* torch.arange(start, end, step=1)
  * Greater than or equal to start and less than end, step by step, makes a **list** of numbers. Default step is 1.
  
### 3. Data Types
Tensors are represented as a list of numbers enclosed in square brackets. 

* torch.FloatTensor(size | list)
  * This method creates tensor that has given size or list. 
  
We can change Numpy to Tensor, vice versa.
* x2 = torch.from_numpy(x1) is for **numpu -> tensor**
* x3 = x2.numpy() is for **numpy <- tensor**
